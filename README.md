Ansible Help
============
You can call it a `cheatsheet` or "general-support" for my other modules. This way I can also refer to some things I put/repeat in **all** my modules which isn't so easy to maintain.

# Problems on Windows
Ã nsible-vault* has not been good to me on Windows laiming *no blocking* or similar, there seems someone has actually made a package that works better:
`pipx install --include-deps ansible-vault-win`  
This propably works using regular old pip too, but I'm using `pipx`at the moement so there you go.
